## Real Research Workflows

A professor at UC Berkeley, Carl Boettiger, is a strong advocate for open science.
We can navigate to the results of his careful workflows at [www.carlboettiger.info](http://www.carlboettiger.info).

The work leading up to his ["Pretty Darn Good Control"](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control) publication is on GitHub, a website integrated with the `git` version control system that work together as a system for project management, collaboration and sharing.
