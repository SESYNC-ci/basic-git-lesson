## Real Research Workflows

A professor at UC Berkeley, [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), is a strong advocate for open science who publishes clear & reproducible workflows.

The work leading up to ["Pretty Darn Good Control"](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control) is on [GitHub](http://github.com), a website integrated with the `git` version control system.

`git` and cloud services like GitHub work well as a system for project management, collaboration and sharing.
