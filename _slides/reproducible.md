Reproducibility is a core tenent of the scientific method.  
An experiment should always be reported in enough detail for a skilled practitioner to duplicate the result.

### Hallmarks of reproducible research

| **Reviewable**  | All details of the method used are easily accessible for peer review and community review.           |
| **Replicable**  | Given sufficient resources, a skilled practitioner could duplicate the research without any guesswork. |
| **Confirmable** | The same conclusions could be obtained *independently*, i.e. without the originator's involvement.     |
| **Auditable**   | Records exist to document how the methods and conclusions evolved, but may be private.                  |
| **Open**        | The orginator grants permissions for reuse and extension of the research products.                        |
