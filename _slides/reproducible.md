### Hallmarks of reproducible research

| **Reviewable**  | All details of the method used are easily accessible for peer review and community review.             |
| **Auditable**   | Records exist to document how the methods and conclusions evolved, but may be private.                 |
| **Replicable**  | Given sufficient resources, a skilled practitioner could duplicate the research without any guesswork. |
| **Open**        | The orginator grants permissions for reuse and extension of the research products.                     |
