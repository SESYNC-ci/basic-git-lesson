## Reproducible Pipeline

The result of reproducible research is more than a published paper. It includes
the whole data-to-document **pipeline**. In a typical socio-environmental
synthesis project, a finished pipeline ideally includes the following steps:

===

1. Aquire raw data from online repository.
1. Extract, transform, and load data into storage for analysis.
1. Perform data analysis (e.g. model inference) and visualization.
1. Update documentation and reports.
1. Publish results, including reports, data and code/software.

===

The pipeline is a direct path through the research cycle, avoiding all its twists
and turns, so others may reproduce your final analysis.

A UC Berkeley professor who is a strong advocate for open science, [Carl
Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), has released several reproducible
pipelines on [GitHub](http://github.com/cboettig). For example, check out his
work leading up to the paper ["Pretty Darn Good
Control"](https://doi.org/10.1890/15-0236) in the project
[pdg_control](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control).
