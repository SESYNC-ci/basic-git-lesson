## A Plug for Reproducibility

Reproducibility is a core tenent of the scientific method.
Experiments are reported in sufficient detail for a skilled practitioner to duplicate the result.

The principle equally applies to modeling and data analysis.

### Hallmarks of Reproducibility

| **Reviewable** | All details of the method used are easily accessible for peer review *and* community review. |
| **Auditable**  | [Private] records exist to document how the methods and conclusions evolved. |
| **Replicable** | Given sufficient resources, a skilled practitioner could duplicate the research without any guesswork. |
| **Open**       | The orginator grants permissions for reuse and extension of the research products. |

### Habits to Cultivate

| **Reviewable** | Thoroughly-comment scripts and share continuously with collaborators          |
| **Auditable**  | Maintain project history to correct mistakes when necessary                   | 
| **Replicable** | Provide "one-click" file & data sharing, of a streamlined analysis "pipeline" | 
| **Open**       | Publically release on GitHub (or similar) with (implied) open licensing       | 

Learning to use git will take care of much of the work needed to make your
research reproducible. Once you become efficient at staging, commiting, pushing
and pulling, it will become the natural way to communicate with your collleagues
through the process of collaborative development of a analysis pipeline.
