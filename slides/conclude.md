## Future Directions

- Share your work for reuse and extension.
- {:.fragment} Make trying new analysis as easy as branching.
- {:.fragment} Contribute beyond your own projects.

The repository you created is an example of the heart of a distributed workflow. Putting the **origin** of your project on GitHub (or similar) will make it accessible not only by your collaborators, but also available for review and extension by your research community.
{:.notes}

Using advanced `git` to manage contributions to the project as a branching and merging "tree" of commits accomplishes two objectives. First, work can safely proceed in parallel, on separate branches if necessary. Second, a recoverable (and auditable) trail of changes is immediately available in the project history.

The latest software for modeling and analysis in your research field may already
be on git. Build better pipelines by contributing bug reports or even pull
requests to projects integral to your own work.
