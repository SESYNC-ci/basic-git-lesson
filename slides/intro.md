## Collaboration & Code

As your research project moves from conception, through data collection,
modeling and analysis, to publishing and other forms of dissemination, its
components can fracture, lose their development history, and---worst of
all---become conflicted or lost. This lesson introduces strategies for
structuring your collaboration, focusing on the core principle of "version
control" (VC) and the related software and cloud solutions. The main objective is to
demonstrate that version control is much more than history, it is
a way for distributed teams to work efficiently on a shared codebase. Version
control is essential for reproducible research.

A cloud **hub** stores project files and their history. Researchers are spokes
on the wheel, each working on a local **repository**. Project integrity is
maintained by rules for synchronizing **commits** between the hub and spokes
when users execute a **push** or **pull**.
