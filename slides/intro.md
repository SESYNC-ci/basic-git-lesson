## Centralized Workflow

As your research project moves from conception, through data collection,
modeling and analysis, to publishing and other forms of dissemination, itâ€™s
components can fracture, lose their development history, and---worst of
all---become conflicted or lost. This lesson introduces a high level strategy for
organizing your collaborative workflow, along with the necessary software and
cloud solutions. Called "the centralized workflow", this strategy targets
distributed work by equal contributors on a shared codebase and is widespread in
collaborative research.

A central **hub** stores project files and their history. Researchers are spokes
on the wheel, each working on a local **clone** of the project. Project
integrity is maintained by rules for synchronizing **commits** between the hub
and spokes when users execute a **push** or **pull** on their local clone.
