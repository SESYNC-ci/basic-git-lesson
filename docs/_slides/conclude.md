## Where to from here?

- The repository you created is an example of the heart of a distributed workflow. Putting the **origin** of your project on GitHub (or similar) will make it accessible not only by your collaborators, but also available for review and extension by your research community.

- {:.fragment} Sharing project files, including managing multiple "copies" during development or at public release, in a hub-and-spokes workflow is a streamlined **cloning** process. The **origin** always has the "gold standard" version of any documents: conflicts must be resolved in the local clone before new commits can be shared.

- {:.fragment} Using advanced `git` to manage contributions to the project as a branching and merging "tree" of commits accomplishes two objectives. First, work can safely proceed in parallel, even on the same documents. Second, a recoverable (and auditable) trail of changes is immediately available in the project history.
