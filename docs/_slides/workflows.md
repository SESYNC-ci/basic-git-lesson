## Workflows

As your research project moves from conception, through data collection, modeling and analysis, to publishing and other forms of dissemination, it's components can fracture, lose their development history, and -- worst of all -- become conflicted.

This lesson gives a high level overview of workflows to organize your project and introduces an accompanying software solution, `git`.

## A real research workflow

A professor at UC Berkeley, [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), is a strong advocate for open science who publishes clear & reproducible workflows. The work leading up to ["Pretty Darn Good Control"](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control) is on [GitHub](http://github.com), a website integrated with the `git` version control system.

Integrating `git` with cloud services like GitHub creates a complete system for project management, collaboration and sharing.
