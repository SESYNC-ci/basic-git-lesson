## Reproducible research: the end result

A professor at UC Berkeley, [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), is a strong advocate for open science who publishes clear & reproducible pipelines. The work leading up to the paper ["Pretty Darn Good Control"](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control) is on [GitHub](http://github.com), a website integrated with the `git` version control system.

Integrating `git` with cloud services like GitHub creates a complete system for project management, collaboration and sharing.
