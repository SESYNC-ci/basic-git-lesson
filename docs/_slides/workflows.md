## Reproducible Research: the finished product

The result of reproducible research is more than a published paper, it includes the whole data-to-document **pipeline**. In a typical socio-environmental synthesis project, a finished pipeline will include [some of] the following steps:

1. [Aquire raw data from online repository.]
1. Extract, transform, and load data into storage for analysis.
1. Perform data analysis (e.g. model inference) and visualization.
1. Save summary information.
1. [Update documentation and publish results.]

A professor at UC Berkeley, [Carl Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), is a strong advocate for open science who publishes clear & reproducible pipelines. The work leading up to the paper ["Pretty Darn Good Control"](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control) is on [GitHub](http://github.com), a website integrated with the `git` version control system.

Integrating `git` with cloud services like GitHub creates a complete system for project management, collaboration and sharing.

## Constructing the pipeline

A **workflow** describes how your team collaboratively creates the code, software environment and integrations that comprise the pipeline. Collaborative workflows require communication&mdash;version control systems facilitate it.
