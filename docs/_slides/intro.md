## Centralized Workflow
{: style="color: #FFFFFF; font-weight: 500;"}

One strategy for distributed work among a team of scientists&mdash;the centralized workflow&mdash;dominates collaborative research.
There is a central hub that stores all the project files.
A number of researchers are spokes around that hub and work independently on private copies of the project.
The integrety of the project is maintained by rules, enforced by the hub, for synchronizing between hub and spokes.
