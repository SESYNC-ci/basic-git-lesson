## A Plug for Reproducible Research

Reproducibility is a core tenent of the scientific method.
Experiments are reported in sufficient detail for a skilled practitioner to duplicate the result.

Does the same principle apply to data analysis? **You bet!**

### Hallmarks of reproducible research:

| **Reviewable**  | All details of the method used are easily accessible for peer review and community review.             |
| **Auditable**   | Records exist to document how the methods and conclusions evolved, but may be private.                 |
| **Replicable**  | Given sufficient resources, a skilled practitioner could duplicate the research without any guesswork. |
| **Open**        | The orginator grants permissions for reuse and extension of the research products.                     |

### Use your workflow to achieve these same goals:

| **Reviewable** | Write-ups and thoroughly-commented scripts shared among collaborators          |
| **Auditable**  | Versioned project history, used to revert mistakes when necessary              |
| **Replicable** | "One-click" file & data sharing, as well as streamlined recreation of analyses |
| **Open**       | GitHub (or similar) based centralized workflow                                 |
