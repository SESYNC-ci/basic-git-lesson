## A Plug for Reproducibility

Reproducibility is a core tenent of the scientific method.
Experiments are reported in sufficient detail for a skilled practitioner to duplicate the result.

The principle equally applies to modeling and data analysis.

### Hallmarks of reproducible research

| **Reviewable** | All details of the method used are easily accessible for peer review and community review.             |
| **Auditable**  | Records exist to document how the methods and conclusions evolved, but may be private.                 |
| **Replicable** | Given sufficient resources, a skilled practitioner could duplicate the research without any guesswork. |
| **Open**       | The orginator grants permissions for reuse and extension of the research products.                     |

### Let your workflow help

| **Reviewable** | Thoroughly-comment scripts and share continuously with collaborators          |
| **Auditable**  | Maintain project history to correct mistakes when necessary                   | 
| **Replicable** | Provide "one-click" file & data sharing, of a streamlined analysis "pipeline" | 
| **Open**       | Publically release on GitHub (or similar) with (implied) open licensing       |
