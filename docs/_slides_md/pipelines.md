## Reproducible Pipeline

The result of reproducible research is more than a published paper, it includes
the whole data-to-document **pipeline**. In a typical socio-environmental
synthesis project, a finished pipeline includes the following
steps:

===

1. Aquire raw data from online repository.

1. Extract, transform, and load data into storage for analysis.

1. Perform data analysis (e.g. model inference) and visualization.

1. Update documentation and reports.

1. Publish results, including reports, data and code/software.

A UC Berkeley professor who is a strong advocate for open science, [Carl
Boettiger](http://www.carlboettiger.info), has released several reproducible
pipelines on [GitHub](http://github.com/cboettig). For example, check out his
work leading up to the paper ["Pretty Darn Good
Control"](https://doi.org/10.1890/15-0236) in the project
[pdg_control](http://github.com/cboettig/pdg_control).

## Workflow vs. Pipeline (a weak analogy)

*Workflow* describes how your team collaboratively creates the code, software
environment and integrations that comprise the *pipeline*. By analogy to a physical pipeline that moves raw material to finished product, your workflow involves everything from drafting plans to testing the product.

Collaborative workflows require communication---developing a pipeline under
version control facilitates it.
