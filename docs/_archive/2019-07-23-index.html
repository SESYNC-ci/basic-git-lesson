<h2 id="collaboration--code">Collaboration &amp; Code</h2>

<p class="notes">As your research project moves from conception, through data collection,
modeling and analysis, to publishing and other forms of dissemination, it’s
components can fracture, lose their development history, and—worst of
all—become conflicted or lost. This lesson introduces strategies for
structuring your collaboration, focusing on the core principle of “version
control” (VC) and the related software and cloud solutions. The main objective is to
demonstrate that version control is much more than history, it is
how distributed teams can work efficiently on a shared codebase and is
widespread in reproducible research.</p>

<p class="on-white">A cloud <strong>hub</strong> stores project files and their history. Researchers are spokes
on the wheel, each working on a local <strong>repository</strong>. Project integrity is
maintained by rules for synchronizing <strong>commits</strong> between the hub and spokes
when users execute a <strong>push</strong> or <strong>pull</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="reproducible-pipeline">Reproducible Pipeline</h2>

<p>The result of reproducible research is more than a published paper, it includes
the whole data-to-document <strong>pipeline</strong>. In a typical socio-environmental
synthesis project, a finished pipeline ideally includes the following steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Aquire raw data from online repository.</li>
  <li>Extract, transform, and load data into storage for analysis.</li>
  <li>Perform data analysis (e.g. model inference) and visualization.</li>
  <li>Update documentation and reports.</li>
  <li>Publish results, including reports, data and code/software.</li>
</ol>

<p>The pipeline is a direct path through the research cycle, avoiding all its twists
and turns, so others may reproduce your final analysis.</p>

<h2 id="rstudio--git">RStudio + git</h2>

<p>Login to your RStudio Server account and upload <code class="highlighter-rouge">handouts.zip</code>. Click on <code class="highlighter-rouge">handouts/handouts.Rproj</code> to open the directory as a project.</p>

<p class="notes">RStudio provides a GUI to the core tools provided by git. Every folder that
contains a “*.Rproj” file is an RStudio project (simply a collection of files
and configuration settings). We use <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> to turn our project into a
“repository”, a term from the software development community that encompases a
project along with its development history.</p>

<h3 id="initialize-git">Initialize git</h3>

<p>Convert your RStudio project to a git repository by enabling version control,
available from the menu bar under “Tools” &gt; “Version Control” &gt; “Project Setup”.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/git-init.png" alt="" /></p>

<p class="notes">Adding a git repository creates a hidden folder in your project called “.git”,
storing all the data about your project’s current and past state.</p>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<p>Once RStudio refreshes your project, there will be a “Git” tab in the same
window as the Environment tab. The window shows files that have content not
already commited in the current state of your project. Choose “Commit” to open a
new window for easy staging and commiting.</p>

<ol>
  <li>check <code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">handouts.Rproj</code></li>
  <li>write a commit message</li>
  <li>commit (but heed the warning!)</li>
</ol>

<p class="notes">Saving, staging, and commiting are each separate steps, none of which imply any
of the others. This may seem like a hassle, but is a good thing! As your project
grows larger, you will frequently save changes you don’t want to commit: staging
lets you choose what changes get packaged into a commit.</p>

<h3 id="history">History</h3>

<p>The history of your project shows a single commit, every new commit will be
chained on top of a preceding commit. Note the “Author” data is probably not
going to be recognized by GitHub and linked to your account.</p>

<p>For GitHub to associate commits with your account, configure git with your
GitHub username and email address.</p>

<div class="language-bash text-document highlighter-rouge" title="worksheet-3.R"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.name jdoe
git config <span class="nt">--global</span> user.email jdoe@sesync.org
git commit <span class="nt">--no-edit</span> <span class="nt">--amend</span> <span class="nt">--reset-author</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notes">Revisit the commit history to confirm that the author information has been
amended for the first commit. In the future, configure your <code class="highlighter-rouge">user.name</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">user.email</code> before starting a project, so you do not have to ammend any
commits. This is a one-time configuration for each computer on which you use
RStudio, so you don’t have to repeat this for any subsequent repositories you
create on this machine.</p>

<h3 id="create-the-hub">Create the Hub</h3>

<p>Sign in or sign up on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>, then create an empty
repository.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/new_repo-1.png" alt="" width="50%" /></p>

<ol>
  <li>Give your repository the same name as your RStudio project.</li>
  <li>Add a short “tag line” about your workshop experience.</li>
  <li><strong>Do not check either box.</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>You have created a repository that has no history—it will accept the commits
made in RStudio without conflict. The quick start information provided by GitHub
explains how to finish configuration of your local git repo.</p>

<div class="language-bash text-document highlighter-rouge" title="Console"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git remote add origin https://github.com/jdoe/handouts.git
git push <span class="nt">-u</span> origin master
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Go back to your GitHub account and check out your “hub”.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">README.md</code> is a Markdown file giving basic information about the repository.</li>
  <li>There is a list of files, including a folder for data.</li>
  <li>You are looking at a branch called <code class="highlighter-rouge">master</code>.</li>
  <li>The commit history is available from the top bar.</li>
  <li>The “Clone or download” button provides a URL.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notes">In addition to being the center point for sharing commits with collaborators,
GitHub is a rich platform for managing projects and inspecting the history.</p>

<p>The <strong>origin</strong> is the central repository, in this case it lives on GitHub. Every member of the team gets a <strong>local</strong> copy of the entire project, called a <strong>clone</strong>.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/atlassian_pull.svg" alt="" width="70%" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" /><br />

<p>Cloning is the initial <strong>pull</strong> of the entire project and all its history. In general, a worker <strong>pulls</strong> the work of other teammates from the <strong>origin</strong> when ready to incorporate their work, and she <strong>pushes</strong> updates to the <strong>origin</strong> when ready to contribute work of her own work.</p>

<p>A git repository is a network of commits, although the current network is a tree
with no splits. After a worker creates a <strong>clone</strong>, the local repo is
in the same state as the <strong>origin</strong>.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/atlassian_clone.png" alt="" width="40%" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" /><br />
<em><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull">Image</a> by Atlassian / <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY</a></em></p>

<p>When the origin has commits that do not exist in the local repo, it has gotten ahead and a <strong>pull</strong> is required to synchronize state.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/atlassian_after_pull_top.png" alt="" width="60%" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" /><br />
<em><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull">Image</a> by Atlassian / <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY</a></em></p>

<p>A <strong>pull</strong>, or initially a <strong>clone</strong>, applies commits copied from the <strong>origin</strong>
to your local repo, as if you had created identical commits locally.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/atlassian_after_pull_bottom.png" alt="" width="60%" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" /><br />

<p>In the opposite situation, commits created locally are not immediately
synchronized to the <strong>origin</strong>.</p>

<em><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing/git-pull">Image</a> by Atlassian / <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY</a></em></p>

<p>A <strong>push</strong> copies local commits to the <strong>origin</strong> and applies them remotely.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/atlassian_after_push_bottom.png" alt="" width="60%" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" /><br />

<p>An essential component of version control is the ability to merge
commit histories that have diverged.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/atlassian_before_merge.svg" alt="" width="60%" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" /><br />
<em><a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/">Image</a> by Atlassian / <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.5/au/">CC BY</a></em></p>

<p class="notes">The commit graph splits any time different commits are applied to the same
“parent” commit. Automatic merging done by git integrates the changes from both
into a new “merge commit””, unsplitting the commit graph.</p>

<p>The <strong>origin</strong> will not accept a push that requires merging. In order to
preserve integrity, the contributor is always responsible for overseeing the
merge on a local <strong>clone</strong>.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/atlassian_after_merge.svg" alt="" width="70%" style="border: none; box-shadow: none;" /><br />

was depicted above for a <strong>push</strong> that the origin will accept.</p>

<h2 id="collaborators">Collaborators</h2>

<p class="notes">Collaboration that goes beyond commenting on a final report—integrated work on
a project from start to finish—raises serious challenges. Distributed
repositories, managed by git, help to answer these questions.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Data, script, or report; who has the latest version?</li>
  <li>Will a collaborator’s work erase or break your own?</li>
  <li>How to recover a working version of a pipeline?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="project-integrity">Project Integrity</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The origin becomes the official “latest” version, even if <em>your</em> work is a
few commits ahead.</li>
  <li>Diverging files are usually automatically merged by git.</li>
  <li>Manual re-integration is aided by the ability to “checkout” the project at any
commit.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notes">Version control software works well with text files. Large, non-text
components of your project (e.g. very big or binary data files) can slow down
any cloning, merging or branch switching. For that reason, data rarely live in a
repository with code and. Keeping data and code separate also facilitates data
reuse—it’s not tied to one pipeline.</p>

<p>Add a section where you can list collaborators to the README.md file. Our aim is
to let your collaborators update this list with their own name, so only include
yourself. You can use any text editor, and RStudio’s is quite handy.</p>

<div class="text-document no-eval highlighter-rouge" title="README.md"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>## Collaborators

- J. Doe
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="stage">Stage</h3>

<p>Before you can commit changes involving a new file, you have to tell git which
modifications you want to commit by staging.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the “Git” tab in RStudio.</li>
  <li>Select “Commit” to open the “Review Changes” window.</li>
  <li>Select “Staged” to add modifications (hence “M”) by “README.md”.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="commit">Commit</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Enter a brief (&lt;50 chars) descriptive message about the commit.</li>
  <li>Commit!</li>
  <li>Close the “Review Changes” window.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="push">Push</h3>

<p>Look at the “Git” tab again and notice that your branch is “ahead of
origin/master”. Push the commit to your GitHub repo.</p>

<h3 id="github-collaborators">GitHub Collaborators</h3>

<p>Even on public GitHub repos, only the owner has “push access” by default. The
owner can allow any other GitHub user to push by inviting collaborators under
the settings tab.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/repo_collab.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Introduce yourself to your neighbor and assign split the two roles below between
you. Be sure to watch eachother perform the steps assigned to your individual
roles.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Owner: add your neighbor as a collaborator.</li>
  <li>Collaborator: accept your neighbor’s emailed invitation.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="create-a-second-spoke">Create a Second Spoke</h3>

<p>The <strong>Collaborator</strong> now needs to create a new project in RStudio by cloning the
<strong>Owner’s</strong> project. Under the “File” menu item, choose to create a New Project,
and then choose “Version Control”.</p>

<p class="notes">You cannot use the same name for two project folders! The <strong>Collaborator</strong>
should chose a different name for their copy of the <strong>Owner’s</strong> project.</p>

<p class="captioned"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sesync-ci/basic-git-lesson@v0.3/docs/assets/images/new_project.png" alt="" /></p>

<h3 id="push--pull">Push &amp; Pull</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Collaborator: Add your name to the list in the “README.md”.</li>
  <li>Collaborator: Stage, commit, and push (up arrow) your modifications.</li>
  <li>Owner: Pull (down arrow) to apply your neighbor’s commit.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="merge">Merge</h3>

<p>You both realize it would have been good to include your affiliation along with
your name. Do you need to circulate “README.md” to each collaborator in sequence
for an update? No!</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ower <strong>AND</strong> Collaborator: edit your entry in the “README.md”</li>
  <li>Ower <strong>AND</strong> Collaborator: stage, commit, &amp; push.</li>
  <li>Owner <strong>OR</strong> Collaborator: if you receive an error message, it tells you
exactly what to do.</li>
</ol>

<p class="notes">After successfully complete a merge, move back to your own “handouts” project
in RStudio to access your own worksheets.</p>

<p class="ToS"><a href="#/slides/collab">Top of Section</a></p>

<hr />
<p><a name="/slides/paths"></a></p>

<h2 id="what-about-data">What about Data?</h2>

<p>The scripts that executes your pipeline are plain text files, but the project
may need other assets, such as data, figures, or private configurations.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Non-text files get little benefit from <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code>, and have large costs.</li>
  <li>Large data files should not be version controlled by <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> and usually live outside the repo (as an “integration”).</li>
  <li>Private information (e.g. personal data) should not be committed to a public repository.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="external-data">External Data</h2>

<p>The most common pipeline integration is shared data storage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Local area network file share (e.g. “Z:\\…”)</li>
  <li>Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive)</li>
  <li>Database (e.g. a PostgreSQL server)</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="link-to-the-data">Link to the Data</h2>

<p>One good practice is creating “symbolic links” (a.k.a. shortcuts) to data files
that live outside a project repo; these let your code use paths that point
inside the repo for data.</p>

<div class="language-r input highlighter-rouge" title="worksheet-3.R"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">file.symlink</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="n">from</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">...</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w">
  </span><span class="n">to</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s1">'data'</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p class="notes">The shortcut works like a normal path to your data—which could be risky on
certain operating systems or early versions (before 1.6) of “git”. It is
sometimes possible to add all your data to a commit by accident with <code class="highlighter-rouge">git add
.</code>. To avoid this, update git or “ignore” all files and folders below <code class="highlighter-rouge">data/</code> by
adding the line <code class="highlighter-rouge">/data/**</code> to the “.gitignore” file in your repo. The leading
<code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> refers to the root of the git repository, not to the root of your
filesystem.</p>

<p class="notes">Learning to use git will take care of much of the work needed to make your
research reproducible. Once you become efficient at staging, commiting, pushing
and pulling, it will become the natural way to communicate with your collleagues
through the process of collaborative development of a analysis pipeline.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Learn more git: merge conflicts, reversion, and branching!</li>
  <li class="fragment">Share your work for reuse and extension.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Make trying new analysis as easy as branching.</li>
  <li class="fragment">Contribute beyond your own projects.</li>
</ul>

<p class="notes">The repository you created is an example of the heart of a distributed workflow. Putting the <strong>origin</strong> of your project on GitHub (or similar) will make it accessible not only by your collaborators, but also available for review and extension by your research community.</p>

<p class="notes">Using advanced <code class="highlighter-rouge">git</code> to manage contributions to the project as a branching and merging “tree” of commits accomplishes two objectives. First, work can safely proceed in parallel, on separate branches if necessary. Second, a recoverable (and auditable) trail of changes is immediately available in the project history.</p>

<p class="notes">The latest software for modeling and analysis in your research field may already
be on git. Build better pipelines by contributing bug reports or even pull
requests to projects integral to your own work.</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<h3 id="exercise-1">Exercise 1</h3>

<p>Make the remaining worksheets show up in your “handouts” repository on GitHub. Remember
the three steps: stage, commit, and push.</p>

<h3 id="exercise-2">Exercise 2</h3>

<p>Repeat the steps you walked through in pairs, as an <strong>Owner</strong> and <strong>Collaborator</strong>,
but reverse the roles.</p>

<p>If you need to catch-up before a section of code will work, just squish it's
🍅 to copy code above it into your clipboard. Then paste into your interpreter's
console, run, and you'll be ready to start in on that section. Code copied by
both 🍅 and 📋 will also appear below, where you can edit first, and then copy,
paste, and run again.</p>
